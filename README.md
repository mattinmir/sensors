## Tips on branches

`git branch <branch>` to create new branch  
`git checkout <branch>` to switch to different branch

To merge changes from <branch> into master, checkout to master branch and run `git merge <branch>` 

`git branch` to see all local branches  
`git branch -d <branch>` to remove local branch

`git branch -a` to see all branches including remote ones  
`git remote prune origin` to remove stale remote branches
